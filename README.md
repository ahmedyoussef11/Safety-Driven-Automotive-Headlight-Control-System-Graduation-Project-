# **Safety-Driven Automotive Headlight Control System**

## **Project Overview**
The **Safety-Driven Automotive Headlight Control System** is an advanced vehicle safety feature aimed at improving night driving and low-visibility conditions. By leveraging **sensor fusion** (using cameras, LIDAR, and V2V communication), the system dynamically adjusts the headlights to improve road visibility, enhance situational awareness, and ensure driver safety.

This project integrates the **YOLOv8 object detection model**, **LIDAR data**, and **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication** to create a seamless and intelligent headlight control system.

## **Key Features**
- **Dynamic Headlight Control**: Automatically adjusts headlight intensity and direction based on real-time sensor data.
- **Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 for real-time object detection through camera images.
- **LIDAR Integration**: Provides precise distance measurements for improved depth perception.
- **V2V Communication**: Enables communication between vehicles to share real-time data (position, speed, and detected objects) for enhanced situational awareness.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from multiple sensors to provide a cohesive understanding of the environment.

## **Technologies Used**
- **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)**: A state-of-the-art object detection algorithm for detecting vehicles, pedestrians, and other obstacles.
- **LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: For accurate distance and depth perception.
- **V2V Communication**: Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication to enhance environmental awareness.
- **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: For managing and integrating sensors, controlling the headlight system, and handling real-time data processing.
- **Python**: The programming language used for the development of the ROS nodes.
